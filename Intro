## Why Are Manchester United Struggling?

As of 04/12/2025, Manchester United sit in **16th place** in the Premier League with just **39 points from 36 matches**. This marks one of the worst seasons in the club’s modern history — and their lowest-ever finish in the Premier League era.

### 📉 The Numbers Behind United’s Historically Poor Season

- **Goals For:** 42 (16th in the league)  
- **Goals Against:** 53 (12th)  
- **Goal Difference:** -11  
- **xG (Expected Goals):** 49.4 (12th)  
- **xGA (Expected Goals Against):** 52.7 (12th)

Despite their poor table position, the underlying data suggests United have **underperformed their expected metrics**. According to the "FootyStats" xPoints table — which simulates expected match outcomes using xG (e.g., a game with 1.8 xG vs 0.98 xG is scored as a 2–1 win) — Manchester United would currently rank **8th**, not 16th.

This data, combined with match analysis, indicates that while United appear to be in freefall, they’re not as far from competing as the table suggests. With **shrewd signings** and **tactical refinements**, especially to improve goal-scoring efficiency and **big chance creation**, United could significantly improve next season.

### ⚠️ Managerial Instability

This season has also been marked by instability in the dugout:

- **Erik ten Hag** was dismissed on **October 28, 2024**, just months after winning the FA Cup against Manchester City. It’s widely believed he would’ve been sacked earlier had he lost that final.
  
- **Ruud van Nistelrooy**, a club legend, took over on an interim basis and oversaw United’s best run of form, going unbeaten in 4 matches, including a 3–0 win over Leicester City.

- Ironically, van Nistelrooy was later hired permanently by **Leicester City** — and subsequently got them relegated — after **Rúben Amorim**, the former Sporting CP manager, accepted the **Manchester United** job on **November 1, 2024**.


### 🧠 Amorim’s System vs. Squad Limitations

Amorim, known for his **structured 3-4-2-1 formation** and tactical discipline, has struggled to implement his philosophy. In his first 26 league matches, he has averaged only **0.96 points per game**. Even more concerning: since January 26th, United have only beaten the relegated duo of Ipswich and Leicester City.

Amorim’s defenders argue that the **squad is not adequately built** for his style of play. A 3-4-2-1 setup requires **dedicated wing-backs** capable of carrying the ball into the attacking third, providing width, and remaining defensively solid. This need was partially addressed with the £30 million signing of **Patrick Dorgu** from Lecce. However, the squad still **lacks a consistent goal scorer**, given **Rasmus Højlund’s struggles**, and also lacks players who naturally fit into the two **attacking midfield roles**.

Nonetheless, the poor results raise serious questions about Amorim’s future. If he fails to win the **Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur**, there may be **yet another managerial change** looming at Old Trafford.
