# 📍 Conclusion: Manchester United’s Rebuild Path

Manchester United have had **seven full-time managers** since legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. This lack of managerial stability is reflected in the current squad — a collection of players recruited under different regimes, many of whom are ill-suited to the current manager’s system.
This project took a **data-driven look** at how the club can rebuild more effectively — particularly by targeting players who are system-flexible, as current manager **Rúben Amorim** is also under pressure and may not remain in charge long-term.

## ⚽ Squad Weaknesses

* **Striker Output**: Despite moments of promise, **Rasmus Højlund** has struggled to deliver as the team’s primary No. 9. His lack of goals has cost United points, but more concerning is his limited movement and inability to create for himself or others — both of which have seriously held the team back.

* **Midfield Progression**: The data shows a midfield lacking in **progressive carries, ball recoveries**, and consistent **creative output** — especially when compared with elite European sides.

* **Squad Depth**: The team is thin and **injury-prone**. In today’s high-intensity football calendar, it’s essential to have quality rotation options available throughout the season.

## 🎯 Transfer Market Opportunities

Using player data from the **top leagues around the world**, this project identified several **forwards and midfielders** who represent strong value and address clear weaknesses:

* **Amad Diallo** and **Bruno Fernandes** are the **only attackers** in the current squad who consistently create goal-scoring opportunities. This is a major concern and must be addressed heading into next season.

* **Liam Delap** provides exceptional value at his current price. Statistically, he offers a significant upgrade over Højlund, particularly in link-up play and xG per shot.

* Recruitment should prioritize **players with specific attributes** that fit modern football — especially in **chance creation, ball progression, and efficient finishing** — rather than just big names or reputations.

## 🔮 The Bigger Picture

Manchester United’s rebuild **won’t be fixed by spending alone**. Smarter recruitment — built on **data, player profiling**, and a clear footballing identity — is the only path forward.

By focusing on **underlying numbers** instead of name recognition, the club can lower risk in the transfer market, build a better-balanced squad, and climb back into Europe’s elite —
**where Manchester United truly belongs.**
