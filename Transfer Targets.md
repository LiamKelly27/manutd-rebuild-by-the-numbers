# 🎯 Manchester United Transfer Target Report

---

## ✅ Scenario 1: With Champions League Football (~£200M Budget)

---

### 1. [Forward] – **Liam Delap**
- **Club:** Ipswich Town  
- **Age:** 22  
- **Nationality:** English  
- **Estimated Fee:** £30M  
- **Note:** Delap reportedly has a £30M release clause triggered by Ipswich's relegation. **(via BBC)** 

#### 🔢 Key Stats:
- **Gls - xG:** +2.7 — One of the top U24 finishers globally.  
- **Shots/90:** 3.4 — Compared to Højlund’s 1.29 and Zirkzee’s 1.8.  
- **Touches in Attacking Third:** 9.46 — More than Højlund’s 6.7.  
- **Key Passes:** 21 — Højlund has just 14.  

#### 🧠 Fit in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1:
Delap would offer a strong focal point for the attack. His link-up play and consistent attacking third involvement make him a great stylistic match, especially for a team struggling with final-third creativity.

#### ✅ Verdict:
Finding a Premier League-proven, physically dominant, young striker for £30M is rare. This deal is a no-brainer in terms of value.

---

### 2. [Right Wing-Back] – **Raoul Bellanova**
- **Club:** Atalanta  
- **Age:** 24  
- **Nationality:** Italian  
- **Estimated Fee:** £30–35M

- **Carries into Final Third:** 46

Excels both offensively and defensively — a rare profile for a wing-back. Would allow Amad Diallo to play higher up and add quality to wide areas.
