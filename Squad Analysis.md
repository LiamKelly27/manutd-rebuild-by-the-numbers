# 🧩 Squad Analysis: Where Manchester United Are Lacking

Manchester United’s current squad is misaligned with the tactical demands of manager **Rúben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system**. While individual quality exists in some areas, the overall structure lacks balance, and certain roles are either poorly staffed or entirely unaddressed.

---

## ❌ 1. Lack of True Wing-Backs

A successful 3-4-2-1 system requires wing-backs who are:

- Fast and fit enough to cover the full length of the pitch  
- Capable of delivering quality crosses and combining in the final third  
- Able to provide width and stretch defenses, creating space for attacking midfielders  
- Defensively disciplined and positionally aware  

### 🔎 Current Options:

- **Diogo Dalot** – Decent going forward, but not a natural wing-back. Better used as depth or emergency cover at center-back.  
- **Luke Shaw** – Injury-prone and not suited to the wing-back role long-term. Should not be counted on for short- or long-term planning.  
- **Noussair Mazraoui** – More of a traditional full-back. In this system, fits better as a wide center-back due to strong passing ability.  
- **Patrick Dorgu** – A recent £30M signing. Lacks polish and needs refinement (especially on his right foot), but has the ideal physical and technical profile.  
- **Amad Diallo** – Arguably the best dribbler on the team. Leads the squad in GCA (Goal Creating Actions) and GCA per 90. While he can play centrally, playing him at wing-back allows Amorim to fit another attacker into the lineup.  
- **Harry Amass** – In his debut season. A natural wing-back, but still very raw and developing.  

### ➡️ Verdict:

United need **at least one elite-level wing-back on each flank** to make Amorim’s system work consistently.

## ⚽️ 2. Absence of a Reliable Striker

After a high-profile move two seasons ago, **Rasmus Højlund** has not delivered:

- Just **4 goals in 30 Premier League appearances**  
- **0 league assists**, and only **9 successful take-ons** from 29 attempts  
- **201 touches in the attacking third** across the season — ranks **254th among all forwards** in the top 10 leagues (fewer than 7 per game)  
- **No headed goals** despite being 6'3", raising concerns over his aerial threat  
- Struggles to make effective runs, create space, or link up with midfielders  

### 🔎 Depth Chart Concerns:

- **Chido Obi** – Highly rated 17-year-old academy product. Technically sharp but still developing physically; not ready for Premier League football.  
- **Joshua Zirkzee** – Can play as a No. 9 but is more effective in deeper roles. Has personally expressed a preference for playing as a No. 10.  

### ➡️ Verdict:

United need to sign a **reliable, well-rounded striker** who can:

- Score **15–20 goals per season**  
- Create their own chances as well as link play  
- Pose a **physical and aerial threat** in both open play and set-piece situations

## 🎯 3. Lack of Quality Attacking Midfielders (CAMs)

In Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, the two attacking midfielders must:

- Find space between the lines  
- Create chances and finish efficiently  
- Be agile, technically gifted, and intelligent in tight areas  

### 🔎 Current Situation:

- **Bruno Fernandes** – Drifts deep or wide; better suited to a deeper playmaking role.  
- **Mason Mount** – Technically sound, but extremely injury-prone. Should be viewed as a rotation piece only.  
- **Rashford, Antony, Sancho** – All natural wingers, not comfortable centrally. All are out on loan and expected to be sold.  
- **Kobbie Mainoo** – Promising young talent. Technically gifted but lacks pace; best suited slightly higher up the pitch.  
- **Alejandro Garnacho** – Direct and aggressive, but extremely inefficient.  
  - Just **30% successful dribble rate** despite a high volume of attempts  
  - **SCA/90: 3.24**, but wasteful with finishing and decision-making  
- **Joshua Zirkzee** – Can play as a striker or CAM. Technically excellent and creative; finished the season strong after a poor start.  

### ➡️ Verdict:

United need **two dynamic, high-IQ attacking midfielders** who can operate between the lines and contribute goals regularly.

## 🔁 4. Midfield Transition Play

The double pivot in a 3-4-2-1 must:

- Protect the back three  
- Progress the ball through pressure  
- Distribute both wide and centrally at pace  

### 🔎 Current Issues:

- **Casemiro** – Aging, with declining agility.  
- **Kobbie Mainoo** – Can fill in, but lacks the motor to play box-to-box consistently.  
- **Manuel Ugarte** – Excellent ball-winner and pressing presence. Solid in possession recycling but not a progressive passer.  
- **Toby Collyer** – Another youth prospect who showed promise but couldn’t stay fit.  

### ➡️ Verdict:

United need a **modern box-to-box midfielder** or a **deep-lying playmaker** to complement Ugarte and transition the ball quickly and cleanly.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts on the Squad

While several players show promise, the squad **isn’t built to maximize Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system**. A successful rebuild depends on:

- Acquiring **functional fits**, not just high-profile names  
- Prioritizing **durability, tactical fit, and versatility**  
- Restructuring around a **clear identity**, especially in wide and attacking roles  

✅ The right transfer window could turn this squad into a serious contender — but only with **strategic investment and positional clarity**.
